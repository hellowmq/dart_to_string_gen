# dart_to_string_gen

 This is a practice of Dart source_gen. Use extension method to generate toString method.

## How To Use

1. Add @ToString() before your Class definition.
```dart
@ToString()
class Animal{}
```

2. Add toString to your Class

```dart
  @override
  String toString() => this._ToString();
```

3. Execute build_runner on the command line

    - In a Dart project
     
        run this command on Command Line
    
        ```
        pub get 
        pub run build_runner build
        ```

    - In a Flutter project

        run this command on Command Line
    
        ```
        flutter pub get 
        flutter pub run build_runner build
        ```
